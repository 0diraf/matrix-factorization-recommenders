# Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems


In this project, I explore matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems. Here, matrix factorization is implemented with the help of scipy's svds() as well as the gradient descent algorithm. The dataset used is the goodreads dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k).

## âœ… Objectives 

*   Implement Matrix Factorization
    *  using scipy's svds()
    *  using gradient descent
*   Implement functions that recommend movies to users using the predicted ratings as estimated by matrix factorization
*   Explore cold-start problem
*   Implement a solution to the cold start problem that does not involve retraining the model.
